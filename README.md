### [Three Metaphors You Can Use to Talk About Zero Trust](https://ghc.anitab.org/)
Zero Trust is all the rage both for [U.S. Federal Agencies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-09.pdf) and the private sector, and it impacts all folks who use enterprise networks.  As your organization increases their use of Zero Trust architecture, you will need to talk to the people impacted outside of the security team so that they can understand why these improvements are needed.

Using Homer’s Odyssey, a trip to a baseball stadium, and the Tower of London, we’ll go through three metaphors that you can use to make Zero Trust architecture relatable and tangible to people both in security and outside of it.  Each one takes the pillars of zero trust – identity, devices, networks, applications, and data – relates it to the metaphor, and explains how they are used together to build a more mature zero trust environment.  This session will help security practitioners build their communication and leadership skills by learning these ways to make complex security topics more accessible to your partners.

### [Measuring Your Zero Trust Maturity](https://www.bsidescharm.org/)
Zero Trust is all the rage in security these days. Where do you begin when trying to move towards a more mature zero trust architecture for your organization? Using the CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model, the Zero Trust team at Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services customized a framework for our environments to better track progress across various axes. We want to share how we did this with you.
